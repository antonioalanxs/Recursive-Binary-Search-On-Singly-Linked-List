# Recursive-Binary-Search-On-Singly-Linked-List
For all fans of data structures (as I do). I give you an implementation that I have made of a recursive version of Binary Search for Singly Linked Lists.

In addition, a small, fast and basic implementation of the data structure in which the algorithm is treated has been made in order to better understand it.
